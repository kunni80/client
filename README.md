# muffin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/small-cake/client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/small-cake/client)

This repository contains the Ember app that handles muffin's admin area.

While it's definitely a big part of muffin, it's not being treated as a real "package". Every time a new version of muffin gets published, it will simply be included in the [main package](https://github.com/small-cake/server). The only reason why it's a separate repo is because it's much cleaner and the folder structure is less deep.

## Usage

If you want to use muffin in one of your projects, you'll find more information [here](https://github.com/small-cake/server).
