# muffin

This repository contains the Ember app that handles muffin's admin area.

While it definitely is a big part of muffin, it's not treated as a real "package". Everytime a new version of muffin gets published, it will simply be included in the [main package](https://github.com/small-cake/server). The only reasons why it's a separate repo is because it's much cleaner and less complex.

## Usage

If you want to use muffin in one of your projects, you'll find more information [here](https://github.com/small-cake/server).
